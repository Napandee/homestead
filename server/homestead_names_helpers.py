"""Names and icons that lived in server.py (track 1, part 8): a DNS-safe
name, Homestead's own group, and an app's display icon with its repair.

server.py binds what it still owns through bind_routes(), the same entry point
every moved module has whether or not it declares ROUTES: each helper in
ROUTE_NEEDS is looked up in server.py when it is called, or, once moved
(server.MOVED), in the module it moved to, so a test that patches it there
reaches it here too; each name in VALUES is server.py's own value."""

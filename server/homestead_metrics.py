"""/metrics (#736): Homestead's own health for Prometheus, Grafana or an
uptime checker, in the Prometheus text format (0.0.4), written by hand.

Off until an admin turns it on (settings.metrics.enabled; Settings ->
Homestead). On, it needs what any other read needs: a signed-in session, or
an API key sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (server.py's key guard lets
keys reach /metrics as well as /api/v1 and /mcp). /metrics needs the `read`
scope, which every key has: every scope includes it
(homestead_api_keys.IMPLIES; tests/test_metrics.py pins that). Off,
it answers 404 after that check, so someone without either learns nothing.

Each replica answers for itself (leader, its loops, its readiness); the
cluster figures are the same from any. The text is built at most every 10 s,
each source in its own try: one that fails is left out and
homestead_metrics_source_up says so, so /metrics never fails on a cluster
problem. Labels come only from fixed sets - loop names, states, severities,
check names - never an app, host, namespace or volume name.

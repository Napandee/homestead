"""Agent requests: what an AI agent asked for that a person has to approve (#417).

A destructive tool (homestead_agent_tools) - a delete, a revert, a restore,
a storage move - or a change only an admin may make never runs on an
agent's say-so. It is planned, and the plan is filed here as a request: the
bell shows it and a push notification announces it (category "agents"),
and it opens on the Agents page with what the plan says will happen.

Anyone whose role allows the action may approve it or deny it - an admin
for what only admins may do in the app. Approving plans it again, as that
person, and runs it only when the new plan is the one that was reviewed
(digest): a volume replaced since, a snapshot gone, a capacity that no
longer fits, and it fails instead, saying so; the agent can ask again.

A request waits TTL at most, and a key may have MAX_PENDING waiting. They
are kept on the data volume, so every Homestead replica sees the same list,
and are dropped KEEP after they end.
